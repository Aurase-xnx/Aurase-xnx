# Hey there 👋

## About me
I'm Dilhan and I'm becoming a full stack dev.
I used to be told a lot that I should work with computers because I was some sort of a "nerd" growing up, they were right.

Big thanks to everyone who thought that I wouldn't make it, you just made me want to climb higher !✌️


- 🔭 Currently working as an intern at MIC
## ⚡ Fun fact
I sometime forget my own name while also being able to remember something from ages ago with too much precision.
